This is the first of what I hope would be many other posts in this website.

I made this platform as a way for me to record and track the progress of whatever I'm working on at any given moment. This is more of a log for my future self than a place to share stuff with other people, although I won't make it private, so if for whatever reason there is something of interest for you in here, you're more than welcome to take a look around.
